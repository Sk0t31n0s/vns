# Visual Novel Studio - Content Creation Guidelines

## Overview

Visual Novel Studio is a platform for creating engaging, educational, and age-appropriate interactive stories. These guidelines help ensure content is suitable for our diverse audience of educators, writers, students, and creative professionals.

## Character Development Guidelines

### Character Stats
* Use the eight core character stats: Intelligence, Creativity, Charisma, Empathy, Courage, Patience, Focus, and Energy
* Character narratives should use a combination of base stats and story-specific attributes
* Avoid hidden stats - allow players to understand character progression clearly
* "Unlockable" stats that appear after story events are acceptable and encouraged

### Character Progression
* Each character should have a meaningful personal growth arc
* Character development should focus on:
  - Learning new skills and abilities
  - Building healthy relationships and friendships
  - Overcoming personal challenges
  - Contributing positively to their community
  - Discovering their passions and talents

## Visual Assets Guidelines

### Image Standards
* **Favor fewer, high-quality images** over numerous low-quality assets
* Take a "visual novel" approach with backgrounds, character sprites, and special event images
* Keep image files optimized: stay within 1920x1080 resolution or ~1MB file size
* Use transparency for character sprites when appropriate

### Art Consistency
* Maintain consistent art style across all character images
* Avoid significant variations in character-defining attributes
* Ensure character expressions match the emotional tone of scenes
* Consider commissioning professional art for key story moments

### Background Usage
* Use generic backgrounds efficiently - don't create multiple backgrounds for similar scenes
* Focus on backgrounds that enhance storytelling: library, town square, nature scenes, etc.
* Prefer backgrounds that support multiple story contexts

## Story and Character Guidelines

### Narrative Structure
* Each character should have a unique, compelling personal story
* Stories should have clear beginning, middle, and end with meaningful character growth
* Include branching story paths that reflect different choices and outcomes

### Character Relationship Development
